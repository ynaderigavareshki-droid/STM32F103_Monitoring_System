# STM32F103_Monitoring_System

A comprehensive real-time monitoring system for STM32F103 microcontrollers using ESP8266 as a web interface and MQTT bridge. This project provides a professional web-based dashboard for monitoring system health, sensor data, and error reporting.

## ‚ú® Features

- Real-time monitoring of STM32F103 microcontroller
- Web interface via ESP8266 Wi-Fi module
- MQTT protocol for data transmission
- Professional dashboard for system health monitoring
- Sensor data visualization
- Error reporting and logging

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

- STM32F103 microcontroller board
- ESP8266 Wi-Fi module
- Sensors (as required by your application)
- Connecting wires and power supply

## üìã Software Requirements

- STM32CubeIDE or preferred STM32 development environment
- Arduino IDE (for ESP8266 programming if needed)
- MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto)
- Web browser for dashboard access

## üîß Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/STM32F103_Monitoring_System.git

Access the web dashboard at the assigned IP

## Development with AI Assistance
This project was developed with the assistance and support of DeepSeek. The AI tool was used as an intelligent assistant throughout the entire development process, including initial idea generation, code implementation, debugging, and optimization.

## Engineer's Role and Responsibility
Although DeepSeek provided valuable assistance, the overall system architecture, algorithm selection, code integration, final review, and quality assurance were entirely under my supervision and responsibility as the project engineer. I retain intellectual ownership and ultimate responsibility for this project.

## Acknowledgements
I sincerely thank the DeepSeek team for providing a powerful tool that enhances productivity and creativity in software development.
